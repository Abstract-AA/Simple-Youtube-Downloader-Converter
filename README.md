# Simple-Youtube-Downloader-Converter


This is a GTK based youtube video downloader. I created this yt-dlp frontend because I wanted a simple tool to download videos and songs. Due to the mimalistic design, the interface can blend well with multiple desktop enviroments. The main inspiration for the design is the app Rhythmbox.
