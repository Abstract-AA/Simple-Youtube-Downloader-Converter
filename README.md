# Simple-Youtube-Downloader-Converter


This is a GTK based youtube video downloader. I created this yt-dlp frontend because I wanted a simple tool to download videos and songs. Playlist download is also supported. 

Due to the mimalistic design, the interface can blend well with multiple desktop enviroments, since it does not look like a gnome app. The main inspiration for the design is Rhythmbox.
